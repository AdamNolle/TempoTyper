# TempoTyper
Keyboard Rhythm Game for Capstone I


# TempoTyper Rules
Players start by choosing a song. They can also choose which letters they want to practice typing. Then, depending on the tempo of the song, a random key is shown at the bottom of the screen (either the left, right, or somewhere in the middle depending on which finger they are expected to use) and moves up to a box near the top of the screen. Once the letter is in the box, the player should then type that letter. There will be multiple letters coming up at a time, so the player will need to make sure to keep typing each of them on beat with the song (when each letter is in a box at the top of the screen).
