# TempoTyper
Keyboard Rhythm Game for Capstone I


# TempoTyper Rules
Players start by choosing a song. Then, letters will come up from the bottom of the screen and once they enter a hitbox at the top (which should coincide with the beat of the song), the player should type that letter. There are 8 different hitboxes depending which finger the player is expected to use to type the letter. At the end of the song, the player will be able to see their score and how many letters they missed and can then choose a new song or choose to quit.
