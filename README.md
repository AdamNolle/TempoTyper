# TempoTyper
Keyboard Rhythm Game for Capstone I  


# TempoTyper Rules
Players start by choosing a song. They can also choose which letters they want to practice typing. Then, depending on the tempo of the song, a random key is shown at the bottom of the screen (either the left, right, or somewhere in the middle depending where it's found on a keyboard) and moves up to a box near the top of the screen. Once the letter is in the box, the player should then type that letter. There will be multiple letters coming up at a time, so the player will need to make sure to keep typing each of them on beat with the song (when each letter is in a box at the top of the screen).
