---Steps to make a song/chart:---

1. Add an mp3 file containing the song you want to use in the 
'Songs' folder.  Give it a title such as 'EasySong.mp3' or
'SongName.mp3'

2. Create a text file to use as the chart. It should be the same 
name as the mp3 file.

3. When creating the chart for the song, type a letter to add a note. 
It would be ideal if the column of the letter matches the finger 
that should be used (For example, if the letter used is 'A', it 
should be placed in the first column to represent the left pinky, 
and the letter 'P' should be in the 8th column to represent the 
right pinky)

4. Keep adding notes until you reach a desired length, or reach the
end of the song.

---Modifying chart settings---

In 'main.py', there should be a constant called 'SONG_LIST' on line 24.
This constant contains an array of all the songs that will be used in
the game. Each index contains a Song object that has the following
parameters:

1. Name of the song (As used in 'Songs' folder)
2. Chart Speed (How fast the notes move)
3. Chart Spacing (How much space is between each note when placed)
4. Difficulty (Should be 'Easy', 'Medium', or 'Hard')

While there are default values present, feel free to change these values
if you would like. There is also more information about these parameters
in the 'Song.py' file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

---Steps to test your song---

1. Make sure that the 'Songs' folder contains the mp3 file of the song
you want to use, as well as the text file of the song chart you made.

2. Make sure that you updated the parameters in one of the indeces of
the 'SONG_LIST' array to match the settings for your song.

3. In line 46 of 'main.py', change the value of the index to match the
index of your song.

4. Run 'main.py', and your song should now be able to be played

---Additional Notes---

1. If you get a 'File Not Found' error when you run the program, you
might have to change the file path on line 142 and line 154 of the
'main.py' file. Since I am using a Mac, the file path format works
for me, but I'm not sure if it works the same on Windows

2. I've noticed that sometimes when running the program, the chart might
not be synced to the music. This is probably due to the song being loaded
at slightly different times each time the program is executed. I haven't
looked too in depth at this issue, but it would still be a good idea to
try running the program multiple times.

3. I made a quick test chart in index 0 of the 'SONG_LIST' array. Feel
free to use it as a reference when creating your chart.
